00:25
I think I was supposed to talk about my new book,
00:28
which is called "Blink,"
00:29
and it's about snap judgments and first impressions.
00:33
And it comes out in January, and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.
00:36
(Laughter)
00:38
But I was thinking about this,
00:40
and I realized that although my new book makes me happy,
00:44
and I think would make my mother happy,
00:46
it's not really about happiness.
00:49
So I decided instead, I would talk about someone
00:53
who I think has done as much to make Americans happy
00:56
as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years,
01:00
a man who is a great personal hero of mine:
01:03
someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,
01:06
who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce.
01:10
Howard's about this high, and he's round,
01:15
and he's in his 60s, and he has big huge glasses
01:20
and thinning gray hair,
01:21
and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality,
01:25
and he has a parrot, and he loves the opera,
01:28
and he's a great aficionado of medieval history.
01:33
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.
01:35
Now, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is,
01:40
although at some point in my life,
01:42
I dated a girl for two years
01:43
who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics.
01:45
Which should tell you something about that relationship.
01:49
(Laughter)
01:51
As far as I know, psychophysics is about measuring things.
01:55
And Howard is very interested in measuring things.
01:57
And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard,
02:00
and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains, New York.
02:04
And one of his first clients was Pepsi.
02:06
This is many years ago, back in the early 70s.
02:10
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,
02:12
"You know, there's this new thing called aspartame,
02:14
and we would like to make Diet Pepsi.
02:16
We'd like you to figure out
02:18
how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi
02:22
in order to have the perfect drink."
02:24
Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer,
02:29
and that's what Howard thought.
02:30
Because Pepsi told him,
02:31
"We're working with a band between eight and 12 percent.
02:34
Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough;
02:37
anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.
02:40
We want to know: what's the sweet spot between 8 and 12?"
02:44
Now, if I gave you this problem to do, you would all say, it's very simple.
02:48
What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi,
02:52
at every degree of sweetness -- eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,
02:56
all the way up to 12 --
02:57
and we try this out with thousands of people,
03:00
and we plot the results on a curve,
03:02
and we take the most popular concentration, right?
03:05
Really simple.
03:06
Howard does the experiment, and he gets the data back,
03:09
and he plots it on a curve,
03:10
and all of a sudden he realizes it's not a nice bell curve.
03:13
In fact, the data doesn't make any sense.
03:15
It's a mess. It's all over the place.
03:18
Now, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such,
03:22
are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess.
03:25
They think, "Well, you know,
03:26
figuring out what people think about cola's not that easy."
03:29
"You know, maybe we made an error somewhere along the way."
03:32
"You know, let's just make an educated guess,"
03:34
and they simply point and they go for 10 percent,
03:37
right in the middle.
03:39
Howard is not so easily placated.
03:41
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards.
03:43
And this was not good enough for him,
03:46
and this question bedeviled him for years.
03:48
And he would think it through and say, "What was wrong?
03:51
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"
03:55
And one day, he was sitting in a diner in White Plains,
03:58
about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafé.
04:01
And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.
04:05
And that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data,
04:07
they were asking the wrong question.
04:09
They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,
04:11
and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis.
04:15
Trust me.
04:16
This was an enormous revelation.
04:19
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science.
04:22
Howard immediately went on the road,
04:24
and he would go to conferences around the country,
04:26
and he would stand up and say,
04:28
"You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi.
04:30
You're wrong.
04:31
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis."
04:34
And people would look at him blankly and say,
04:37
"What are you talking about? Craziness."
04:39
And they would say, "Move! Next!"
04:41
Tried to get business, nobody would hire him --
04:43
he was obsessed, though,
04:44
and he talked about it and talked about it.
04:46
Howard loves the Yiddish expression
04:48
"To a worm in horseradish, the world is horseradish."
04:51
This was his horseradish.
04:53
(Laughter)
04:54
He was obsessed with it!
04:57
And finally, he had a breakthrough.
04:59
Vlasic Pickles came to him,
05:02
and they said, "Doctor Moskowitz, we want to make the perfect pickle."
05:06
And he said,
05:07
"There is no perfect pickle; there are only perfect pickles."
05:11
And he came back to them and he said,
05:13
"You don't just need to improve your regular;
05:15
you need to create zesty."
05:16
And that's where we got zesty pickles.
05:19
Then the next person came to him: Campbell's Soup.
05:22
And this was even more important.
05:24
In fact, Campbell's Soup is where Howard made his reputation.
05:27
Campbell's made Prego,
05:28
and Prego, in the early 80s, was struggling next to Ragù,
05:32
which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the 70s and 80s.
05:36
In the industry -- I don't know whether you care about this,
05:39
or how much time I have to go into this.
05:41
But it was, technically speaking -- this is an aside --
05:44
Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragù.
05:46
The quality of the tomato paste is much better;
05:48
the spice mix is far superior;
05:50
it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way.
05:52
In fact, they would do the famous bowl test
05:54
back in the 70s with Ragù and Prego.
05:57
You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?
06:01
And the Ragù would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.
06:06
That's called "adherence."
06:07
And, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence,
06:12
and the quality of their tomato paste,
06:15
Prego was struggling.
06:16
So they came to Howard, and they said, fix us.
06:19
And Howard looked at their product line, and he said,
06:22
what you have is a dead tomato society.
06:26
So he said, this is what I want to do.
06:28
And he got together with the Campbell's soup kitchen,
06:30
and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce.
06:34
And he varied them according to every conceivable way
06:37
that you can vary tomato sauce:
06:39
by sweetness, by level of garlic,
06:40
by tomatoey-ness, by tartness, by sourness,
06:44
by visible solids --
06:45
my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business.
06:48
(Laughter)
06:49
Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce,
06:53
he varied spaghetti sauce.
06:55
And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces,
06:58
and he went on the road.
07:00
He went to New York, to Chicago,
07:02
he went to Jacksonville, to Los Angeles.
07:03
And he brought in people by the truckload into big halls.
07:07
And he sat them down for two hours,
07:09
and over the course of that two hours, he gave them ten bowls.
07:12
Ten small bowls of pasta,
07:14
with a different spaghetti sauce on each one.
07:17
And after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100,
07:21
how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was.
07:24
At the end of that process, after doing it for months and months,
07:27
he had a mountain of data
07:29
about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce.
07:33
And then he analyzed the data.
07:34
Did he look for the most popular variety of spaghetti sauce?
07:38
No! Howard doesn't believe that there is such a thing.
07:41
Instead, he looked at the data, and he said,
07:43
let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.
07:49
Let's see if they congregate around certain ideas.
07:52
And sure enough, if you sit down,
07:54
and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce,
07:57
you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.
08:01
There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain;
08:04
there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;
08:07
and there are people who like it extra chunky.
08:09
And of those three facts, the third one was the most significant,
08:14
because at the time, in the early 1980s,
08:16
if you went to a supermarket,
08:18
you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.
08:21
And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,
08:24
"You're telling me that one third of Americans
08:26
crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce
08:30
and yet no one is servicing their needs?"
08:32
And he said "Yes!"
08:33
(Laughter)
08:34
And Prego then went back,
08:36
and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce,
08:38
and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely
08:42
took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.
08:45
And over the next 10 years, they made 600 million dollars
08:49
off their line of extra-chunky sauces.
08:53
Everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done, and they said,
08:56
"Oh my god! We've been thinking all wrong!"
08:58
And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar,
09:02
and 14 different kinds of mustard, and 71 different kinds of olive oil.
09:07
And then eventually even Ragù hired Howard,
09:11
and Howard did the exact same thing for Ragù that he did for Prego.
09:14
And today, if you go to a really good supermarket,
09:16
do you know how many Ragùs there are?
09:18
36!
09:20
In six varieties:
09:22
Cheese, Light,
09:25
Robusto, Rich & Hearty,
09:28
Old World Traditional --
09:32
Extra-Chunky Garden.
09:34
(Laughter)
09:36
That's Howard's doing.
09:37
That is Howard's gift to the American people.
09:40
Now why is that important?
09:41
(Laughter)
09:44
It is, in fact, enormously important.
09:46
I'll explain to you why.
09:47
What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks
09:51
about making you happy.
09:54
Assumption number one in the food industry used to be
09:57
that the way to find out what people want to eat,
09:59
what will make people happy, is to ask them.
10:02
And for years and years and years,
10:04
Ragù and Prego would have focus groups,
10:06
and they would sit you down, and they would say,
10:09
"What do you want in a spaghetti sauce?
10:10
Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce."
10:13
And for all those years -- 20, 30 years --
10:16
through all those focus group sessions,
10:18
no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky.
10:21
Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.
10:25
(Laughter)
10:27
People don't know what they want!
10:29
As Howard loves to say,
10:31
"The mind knows not what the tongue wants."
10:33
It's a mystery!
10:35
(Laughter)
10:36
And a critically important step
10:38
in understanding our own desires and tastes
10:41
is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want, deep down.
10:46
If I asked all of you, for example, in this room, what you want in a coffee,
10:50
you know what you'd say?
10:51
Every one of you would say, "I want a dark, rich, hearty roast."
10:56
It's what people always say when you ask them.
10:58
"What do you like?" "Dark, rich, hearty roast!"
11:01
What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?
11:04
According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.
11:08
Most of you like milky, weak coffee.
11:10
(Laughter)
11:11
But you will never, ever say to someone who asks you what you want
11:15
that "I want a milky, weak coffee."
11:17
So that's number one thing that Howard did.
11:21
Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize --
11:25
it's another very critical point --
11:27
he made us realize the importance
11:29
of what he likes to call "horizontal segmentation."
11:33
Why is this critical?
11:34
Because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard.
11:37
What were they obsessed with in the early 80s?
11:40
They were obsessed with mustard.
11:41
In particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon.
11:45
Used to be, there were two mustards: French's and Gulden's.
11:48
What were they? Yellow mustard.
11:49
What's in it?
11:50
Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric, and paprika.
11:52
That was mustard.
11:53
Grey Poupon came along, with a Dijon.
11:56
Right?
11:57
Much more volatile brown mustard seed, some white wine, a nose hit,
12:03
much more delicate aromatics.
12:05
And what do they do?
12:06
They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it,
12:11
made it look French,
12:12
even though it's made in Oxnard, California.
12:14
(Laughter)
12:15
And instead of charging a dollar fifty for the eight-ounce bottle,
12:20
the way that French's and Gulden's did,
12:21
they decided to charge four dollars.
12:23
And they had those ads.
12:24
With the guy in the Rolls Royce, eating the Grey Poupon.
12:27
Another pulls up, and says, "Do you have any Grey Poupon?"
12:30
And the whole thing, after they did that, Grey Poupon takes off!
12:33
Takes over the mustard business!
12:35
And everyone's take-home lesson from that
12:37
was that the way to make people happy
12:42
is to give them something that is more expensive,
12:45
something to aspire to.
12:47
It's to make them turn their back on what they think they like now,
12:51
and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy.
12:55
(Laughter)
12:56
A better mustard! A more expensive mustard!
12:58
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning.
13:01
And Howard looked to that and said, "That's wrong!"
13:04
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy.
13:07
Mustard exists, just like tomato sauce, on a horizontal plane.
13:11
There is no good mustard or bad mustard.
13:14
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.
13:17
There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.
13:21
He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste.
13:26
And for that, as well, we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks.
13:31
Third thing that Howard did, and perhaps the most important,
13:34
is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish.
13:37
(Laughter)
13:38
What do I mean by that?
13:39
(Laughter)
13:41
For the longest time in the food industry,
13:43
there was a sense that there was one way,
13:46
a perfect way, to make a dish.
13:49
You go to Chez Panisse,
13:51
they give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds
13:56
in a something something reduction.
13:58
They don't give you five options on the reduction.
14:01
They don't say, "Do you want the extra-chunky reduction, or ...?"
14:04
No!
14:05
You just get the reduction. Why?
14:07
Because the chef at Chez Panisse
14:08
has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi.
14:11
"This is the way it ought to be."
14:13
And she serves it that way time and time again,
14:18
and if you quarrel with her, she will say,
14:20
"You know what? You're wrong!
14:22
This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant."
14:25
Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well.
14:29
They had a Platonic notion of what tomato sauce was.
14:32
And where did that come from? It came from Italy.
14:35
Italian tomato sauce is what?
14:37
It's blended; it's thin.
14:39
The culture of tomato sauce was thin.
14:41
When we talked about "authentic tomato sauce" in the 1970s,
14:44
we talked about Italian tomato sauce,
14:46
we talked about the earliest Ragùs,
14:48
which had no visible solids, right?
14:51
Which were thin, you just put a little bit
14:53
and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta.
14:55
That's what it was.
14:56
And why were we attached to that?
14:58
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy
15:00
was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce, A.
15:05
And B, we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce,
15:10
then they would embrace it.
15:12
And that's what would please the maximum number of people.
15:15
In other words,
15:17
people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals.
15:21
They were looking for one way to treat all of us.
15:23
And it's good reason for them to be obsessed
15:26
with the idea of universals,
15:27
because all of science,
15:29
through the 19th century and much of the 20th,
15:31
was obsessed with universals.
15:33
Psychologists, medical scientists, economists
15:37
were all interested in finding out the rules
15:39
that govern the way all of us behave.
15:42
But that changed, right?
15:43
What is the great revolution in science of the last 10, 15 years?
15:47
It is the movement from the search for universals
15:50
to the understanding of variability.
15:53
Now in medical science, we don't want to know, necessarily,
15:57
just how cancer works,
15:58
we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer.
16:02
I guess my cancer different from your cancer.
16:04
Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability.
16:08
What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying,
16:11
"This same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce."
16:16
And for that, we owe him a great vote of thanks.
16:20
I'll give you one last illustration of variability,
16:23
and that is -- oh, I'm sorry.
16:24
Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step,
16:28
which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food,
16:33
we aren't just making an error;
16:35
we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice.
16:39
And the example he used was coffee.
16:41
And coffee is something he did a lot of work with, with Nescafé.
16:45
If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee --
16:49
a type of coffee, a brew -- that made all of you happy,
16:52
and then I asked you to rate that coffee,
16:54
the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100.
16:58
If, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters,
17:02
maybe three or four coffee clusters,
17:04
and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters,
17:09
your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78.
17:13
The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78
17:18
is a difference between coffee that makes you wince,
17:21
and coffee that makes you deliriously happy.
17:24
That is the final, and I think most beautiful lesson,
17:27
of Howard Moskowitz:
17:29
that in embracing the diversity of human beings,
17:33
we will find a surer way to true happiness.
17:35
Thank you.
17:36
(Applause)
