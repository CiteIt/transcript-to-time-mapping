Hello, this is Tim Langeman, creator of CiteIt.net -- setting a higher standard of

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.480
citation, for news organizations and web
authors.  Often when I read a quotation I

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.290
think to myself..  "that's a nice quote but
I wonder what it says two sentences

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.730
prior or two sentences later." In other
words, what's the context and how do I

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.439
know this quote wasn't cherry-picked?
In Washington DC, the Jefferson Memorial has

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.990
a badly cherry-pick quote etched into
the northeastern wall. Here it is --

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.260
"Nothing is more certainly written in the
book of fate than that these people are

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.390
to be free." That sounds great, but it's
just an excerpt. Using CiteIt.net, I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.870
can link to quote to the full text,
making it possible to click on the blue

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.180
down arrow and reveal the quote's next
500 characters . "Nor is it less

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.129
certain that the two races, equally free,
cannot live in the same government.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.550
Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible
lines of distinction between them.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.770
It is still in our power to direct the
process of emancipation and deportation.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.719
If you look at the text above the quote,
you can see that Jefferson was arguing

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.430
that African Americans should work for a
period of time as slaves and then be

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.380
deported at a "proper age." Sometimes
added context changes everything.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.670
Given how CiteIt.net exposes cherry-picked quotations,  no news organization or

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.560
author attempting to deceive their readers

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.330
would use it.  CiteIt.net isn't about
exposing anyone. Rather, it's a tool for

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.409
responsible news organizations and
authors who choose to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.979
differentiate themselves by holding
themselves up to a higher standard,

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.060
giving readers confidence in their
integrity and a greater understanding of

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.930
their sources. Let's now look at a
second example -- this time where the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.070
author is not trying to cherry-pick but
rather to provide their readers with an

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.689
easy way to learn more about a quote's
context.  Here's a Bible passage

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.520
portraying Jesus's temptation in the
wilderness from Matthew 4.  The tempter

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.939
came and said to him:  "If you are the son
of God, command these stones to become

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.710
loaves of bread.  But he answered, "it is
written, "One does not live by bread

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.000
alone, but by every word that comes from
the mouth of God."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.680
To many Christians, this biblical
passage is familiar, yet few recognize

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.480
Jesus's response as a quote from
Deuteronomy 8. If you click on the blue

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620
arrows, you can see I've cited the verse
by linking it to a web version of the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.750
NRSV translation of Deuteronomy at biblegateway.com. Linking this first to an

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.430
Internet source allows me to use the
CiteIt.net web service to automatically

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.870
pull in the surrounding 500 characters
before and after the quote. This allows

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.860
readers to quickly see the section of
Deuteronomy the Jesus was citing

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.450
and easily learn more. In conclusion,
CiteIt.net aims to set a higher

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.040
standard of citation for news
organizations and web authors. It allows

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.800
readers to easily verify the context
and learn more. CiteIt.net dot is free and
