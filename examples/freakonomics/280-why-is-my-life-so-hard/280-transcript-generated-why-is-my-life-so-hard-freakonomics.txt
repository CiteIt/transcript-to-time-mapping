to feel that life is made things harder for them that it has four other people that's Tom gilovich, professor of psychology at Cornell University and I've study how people make judgments and decisions in their everyday and professional lives and Shai davidai Hebrew site that he died and I'm an assistant professor of psychology at the new school for social researchhilditch and David I recently published a paper called the headwinds Tailwinds asymmetry in addition to being a clever piece of experimental research it has an amazing capacity to make you feel both much better about your life and much worse in a nutshell that is the paper it explains why you think your parents were tougher on you than your siblings so my older sister she had all the freedom because she was older she got to go out and do things but I got punished it explains why rooting for your sports team could be so painful there is a tendency to if you like the team that you favor has a harder time than ever team explains why Democrats are convinced the deck is stacked against them and why Republicans are convinced of the same thing they really areand most important it explains why most of us aren't nearly as grateful as we oughta be how did I get even to be alive how did I get to be a live in a world that has the beauty that it does and so on today I'm Freakonomics radio how we build resentments how those resentments can curdled our well-being and how we would all benefit from feeling some more gratitude okay I'll try it today I'm grateful for that song you know the song that goes like this from WNYC Studios this is Freakonomics radio the podcast that explores the Hidden Side of Everything here's your host Stephen Dubner so what are you grateful for today I'm grateful for Tom Shai davidai again I had the best graduate school advisor mentor and friend in town and the fact that we could sit there for hours and just talk about our ideas and then go and see if those ideas are real run experiments and you don't even talk about that was just an amazing experience for what it's worth the feeling's mutual shiz just terrific and I'm convinced is going to have a great career 33 years old got his PhD in Psychology just a couple years ago if you were going to pick up Mentor in the field you couldn't do much better than Tom gilovich you're too kind many of the topics we've discussed on this program over the years especially those relating to behavioral economics debt to gilovich is research I'd love to read off just a quick list of phenomena that you're known for studying in some cases pioneering and maybe have you just give a very brief description of what the thing is and what it means so I'm never won the spotlight effect you have a spotlight effect refers to a feeling most of us can relate to its the feeling that when we're doing something that other people are really attending to what we're doing that the social spot light is honest and it turns out that other people are paying much less attention to us than we think ranks the hot hands notion or maybe the hot hand fallacy well everyone who's ever played the game of basketball just know she get this feeling where the game seems to slow down it becomes easier you almost don't even have to aim that carefully the balls just going to go ahead it's one of the most compelling feelings that and it turns out a few statistically analyze people's shots whether it's professional games college basketball player shooting in a gym although the feeling exists when you make several shots in a row you will feel hot that feeling very surprisingly doesn't predict how you're going to do in the next shot that are the next several shots the distribution of hits and misses in the game of basketball looks just like the distribution of heads and tails when you're flipping a coin and although course not every player shoots exactly 50% very few of them do about your work in happiness or hedonic studies so many psychologists who study judgment decision-making have an interest in well-being or happiness as well because after all week we try to make sound judgments and decisions to advance Star Physical and psychological well-being the question just asks itself how good a job do we do all of that and how can we advance our well-being more and in my particular case that has involved studying such emotions as regret decisions gone awry gratitude either on the part of decisions that have worked out well or just events that have happened to a person that you feel grateful for briefly describe your research into bias blind spot bias blind spot is refers to the fact that everybody knows that people are biased but it's much easier to see the bias in other people than in oneself and and one last one and this one it strikes me please in to today's conversation about headwinds and Tailwinds self-handicapping describe that for me briefly self-handicapping is familiar idea particularly if we go back the World of Sports Wear before a contest people claim a certain obstacle in their favorite team's path that you know maybe we'll win but was a key player out and that's setting everyone up for an explanation if you should lose students often do this to they might study as hard as they can and pretend that they haven't studied so if they bomb the exam people don't think they're challenged and if they should succeed all the better the more glorious Victory if you've overcome an obstacle so people will put these obstacles in their path to manage other people's and their own attributions are explanations for why they succeeded or failed why people succeed and fail important topic plainly but a complicated one specially for academic psychologists like gilovich and David I it's a huge question a messy quest in Bhutan of variables hard to measure but people's attributions or explanations for why they succeeded or failed that they could explore we wanted to try to get a handle on how or why it's so easy for people to feel put-upon to feel resentful to feel that life is made things harder for them that it has four other people and at the same time try to understand why it might be hard for people to be as grateful as perhaps we should which gets us to their paper the headwinds Tailwinds asymmetry the idea should be familiar to anyone who Cycles or guns for exercised sometimes you're running or cycling into the wind and it's not pleasant you're aware of it the whole time it's retarding your progress and you can't wait until the course changes so that you get the wind at your back and when that happens you're grateful for about a minute and very quickly you no longer notice the wind at your back that's helping push you along and what's true when it comes to running or cycling is true of Life generally you argue that gratitude has been shown to be good for us what's the evidence for that a lot of people have done work on gratitude over the last 20 years where they'll do things like have people keep a gratitude diary where everyday or every week you write down what you have to be grateful for most people do at the evening just before we go to sleep and you do that for a few days in a row and then you just see people are happier more satisfied with their lives or you have assignments to write a letter to a person every week expressing gratitude for something they've done for you giving it to someone face-to-face I'm not just emailing them but actually sitting there having them read it and then having a conversation about it said when people do that they sleep better they go to the doctor less often so show less depressive symptoms so they're all sorts of direct benefits to the Grateful person it's just amazing how many positive correlates there are two gratitude but when you ask people what they're grateful for when you ask people what are you grateful for the prototypical answer is my parents my family my friends my loved ones what they're missing is oldies Invisibles what are these Invisibles are there so many the fact that I had opportunities for Education how did I get even to be alive the fact that we can sit here and talk when is monitoring what we're talking about that is something not everyone had that is something that we should feel grateful for comedian Louis CK has a brilliant bit on this is called Everything is amazing and no one cares child mortality has declined dramatically in the past hundred years and talks about example after example of some new technology comes in you're all excited and then 10 minutes later it's not a luxury it's a necessity and I'm sitting on the Internet it's fast and I'm watching YouTube clips it's a mammal an airplane and then it breaks down and they apologized the internet's not working the next Migos. white how quickly the world owes him something yes he knew existed only 10 seconds ago treadmill you run really hard to get something the thing that you get that you're aiming for feels good when you got it but then you adapt to it and you have to run ever faster to get more and more but here's a question if gratitude is such a positive emotion it's just amazing how many positive correlates there are two gratitude then you think we'd all be chasing after that hard all the time so why aren't we get rich and David I suspect it has to do with what psychologists called the availability bias meaning we tend to overweight the experiences that are readily available in our memories which television David I argue are more likely to be headwinds and Tailwinds we have to pay attention to the barriers in front of us because we have to get over them get through them in some way we have to overcome them we don't have to pay attention to those things that are boosting us a lot we can just be boosted a lot and that fundamental asymmetry inattention is the headwinds Tailwinds asymmetry meaning that it's easier to summon emotions that are the opposite of gratitude in fact do the enemies of gratitude one of them is habituation or adaptation that we think of some good fortune to felis we'd be happy we'd be grateful it would be happy forever we wouldn't sweat the small stuff anymore and that's true for a while but then we adapt to it and all of a sudden we're sweating the small stuff again but that's hardly the only enemy of gratitude the big ones are greed and envy greed this is not enough it's not a means to an end having is the the end when you experience Creed and when you were just missing on this accumulation it's hard for you to take stock of what you already have and envy which is when all you're focused on is whatever people have especially when it's malicious and not benign and be when you're really focusing on you know I don't want him to have that they didn't deserve this it's unfair when you experience Dad it's hard to stop and feel grateful that's a theory at least once Tom gilovich and Shai davidai identified it all they had to do was find evidence that it's actually true if this headwinds Tailwinds asymmetry is a real psychological phenomena we should find it in very different context in domains coming up on Freakonomics radio evidence of head winds in Family Matters Sports and politics and how feeling the headwinds might persuade you that your country is in worse shape than it is and that you need a new leader really shake things up a willingness to do that I think is failing to appreciate all the things that make our lives really the Envy of the rest of the world the academic psychologist Tom gilovich and shy David I wanted to know whether people put more emphasis on the headwinds they face the barriers and obstacles and difficulties than their tail winds like a free Society in good health and so on this meant trying to measure people's perception of headwinds and Tailwinds in a variety of domains so we did studies to see how it affects siblings views of whether they had it harder than their brother or sister or easier whether Republicans and Democrats think that this strange thing known as The Electoral College favors their side or hurts their side weather sports fans think that the schedule is fair and then my favorite example comes from my own field of Academia in Psychology if you talk to graduate students in different sub disciplines each sub-discipline will think the other ones have it easier than they do developmental psychologist will say I may I wish I was a social psychology person I wouldn't so much easier to run college student Senate is to run a baby but then you talk to the social psychologists I got the development of us have it so easy they have a sample size is like 6 to 8 we have to run a hundred in each condition and every every group bemoans its own difficult fate okay we'll start with the sibling study there one thing that we kept coming back to is this idea that siblings always feel like the other one had it easier for the study David I am Gilbert recruited people who had only one sibling no twins allowed and we asked him to think back to when they were younger living at the same house think about how I treated them purses Vera brother or sister who got more praise who got more encouraged to do things who had more freedom to go out and party and and contrast who got punished more who got lectured more and what we found was that siblings fought the other one had it easier and that they had it harder another words headwinds everybody another study looked at how self-identified Democrats and Republicans think their party makes out in terms of raising campaign money and getting come to cooperate and winning the Electoral College as with the siblings people on either side of the political I'll felt the other side had all the advantages would the same effect hold true among sports fans so what we did is event on Reddit on the NFL of subsection of red it's right after the 2014 schedule. Published let me just wanted to see how people are reacting specifically they wanted to see how fans perceive their teams upcoming schedule do I tend to think that my team had it easier or harder the headwinds Tailwinds asymmetry predicts that what would jump off the page of the schedule when you look at her all the hard games your team has to play was most of the comments were about how difficult it is for me finally gilovich and David I looked at some of their academic Brethren to see if they chew primarily feel bad ones look up accounting professors they can like in many disciplines be divided into experimental and non-experimental accountant what's experimental accountant what they do is study the human aspect in the human behavior of accounting so things like auditing things like when do people lie and when can we detect line stuff like that television David I surveyed roughly a hundred experimental and non-experimental accountants and we asked each of them how easy is it for experimental and non-experimental accountants to get their papers published to get grants to get tenure and so on and each of them thought that it was easier for the other group then it was for them to have these good things happen but it is Saturday we added a Twist after having them get themselves in touch with their head winds more than their tail is we then ask them about a variety of what Michael questionable research practices is it okay to take money from a questionable Source if the research itself is okay is it okay to publish the same paper twice in two very different journals can you put your name on a paper as a co-author if you really didn't do anything to see is the senior field and yourself is disadvantage does that give you more moral flexibility does that allow you in your own mind to maybe cut some corners and what you find is that if people have just thought about who has it harder or easier them or other people in their discipline they are more accepting of these questionable research practices so when you feel like no the deck is stacked against me it appears that people want to make up for that and they're willing to kind of bend the rules to do that and obviously that has a lot of implications for for real life it encourages feeling resentful and unappreciative and so that's a psychological state where we're not at our best I'm curious how the idea of headwinds and Tailwinds plays into the conversation these days about privilege vs. discrimination or lack of opportunity so there's a lot of conversation about white and or male privilege perhaps that's an example of a Tailwind that aren't properly appreciated and on the other side some claims of discrimination or lack of opportunity perhaps being example of of headwinds being exaggerated I'm curious what your thoughts are on that I think the what we've shown in the lab is directly applicable to some of the discussions going on in the country right now there's this term that that there's a war on white males these days white Christian men add Channel Through the headwinds Tailwinds asymmetry you could see why that group would think that that is to say the influence they've had has decreased and of course that's the focus of their attention that decrease at the same time if you look at it from the outside what you see is an enormous advantage that it existed for hundreds of years being produced just a little bit and from an outside perspective it doesn't look like at all like a war it looks like that just a little a little bit of rebalancing and we even need to rebalance some are what about on the flip side what about if I feel aggrieved if I feel I am facing way more headwinds than the other people around me whether it's in the labor market sir in Academia or whatever do you see that misperception being a significant barrier to progress for meeting again individually or societally I do because it feeds resentment which doesn't make us our best selves that prevents us from thinking most rationally and acting most productively each Community is going to think that the other one has it easier than they do when in fact they don't that's the misperception and if they think that the other group has it easier that's tempting first of all it's going to make them less likely they want to do good things for people in the other community and it might even encourage them to do some questionable things to in their minds even though the Slate is already even it's that misperception that we're particularly interested in let me ask you a related question what do you know or what does the field know about the characteristics of people who don't overweight head winds that's a great question that's something the chai and I are working on right now and it's not that we're never aware of our tail winds and they just don't come up or we are less aware of them than their head Wednesday and so we've asked people we explain the headwinds Tailwinds asymmetry and we ask them what are the some of the headwinds you suffered from in the tail when she's benefited from and we get some noticeable differences that is the headwinds are quite a mix of animate things other people who are getting in my way and inanimate things bureaucracies procedures structural things but when you look at the Tailwind people are aware of they tend to cite way disproportionately the intervention of other people when other people do things for us it's a Charming result in a way that that registers and we're grateful if you tell people how lucky they are they don't like that they guard against it there a lightweight what are you you're diminishing my achievements but if you ask people how has luck played a role in your life people can get in touch with their tail winds are how lucky they are so it it really suggest and ask don't tell policy when it comes to either lock particular type of tail when they're all the other tail went so, let me ask you this let's say I've heard you discussing this and I find you an incredibly you know even handed incredible assessor of these phenomena and then I believe you I believe your research what can I do to appreciate them the reality of my tail winds and to not overweight not get resentful in there for counterproductive as result of my head winds right scientists are so fond of saying and I do believe it that you know knowledge set you free just knowing about this will be helpful so I want to put that out first and foremost but the more specific version of the knowledge tends to be most helpful you've had guests on before that have talked about the confirmation bias one of the most powerful sources of distortion in our judgments when we're testing or trying to evaluate something we look for Eva chance that it's true because after all that work there should be evidence for it so we look forward very sensible thing to do but we also have to look for evidence against and so the general recommendation there is all right don't fall prey to the confirmation bias tried to consider the opposite is the way that psychologists put it that's the evidence for this what's the evidence against it and that's good advice but it's a little general it would be nice to make it more concrete and so psychologists have developed some more concrete recommendations what is too and I really like this one is to do what's called a pre-mortem that is to say if you believe that a certain policy is the right one you tend to over recruit evidence in favor of that belief you try the policy rather than telling people consider the opposite you say Okay imagine that you tried the policy and after a year it crashed and burned and you'd be doing a post-mortem figure out what went wrong do that in advance do that right now imagine that worked out badly and then explain it to yourself that is a more specific recommendation that I think people can really sink their teeth into or have a devil's advocate to argue against you that's specific that's doable and so it's more helpful EXO with respect to the headwinds Tailwinds asymmetry I think of it and part us a slightly more specific version of what the Gratitude researchers have been asking people to do which is right down or think about all that you have to be grateful for our that's good advice but it can be hard to do or at least hard to do consistently if you start to run out of gas and doing that ask yourself a slightly different question which is what are my Tailwind not but I have to be grateful for but one of the ways in which I'm boost along the invisible things that make my life easier let me focus on those and different things might come up as it is written May the road rise up to meet you May the wind always be at your back to which I guess we should add and that you appreciate the wind when it's at your back and when it's not deal with it a little less resentfully thanks to Tom gilovich of Cornell and Shai davidai
