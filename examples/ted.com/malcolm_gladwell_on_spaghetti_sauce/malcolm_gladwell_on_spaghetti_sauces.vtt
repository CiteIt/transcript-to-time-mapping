 Translator: Ayman Mahmoud Checker: Anwar Dafa-Alla 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 I think I was supposed to talk about my first book, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Entitled "Flash," which is about issuing instant judgments and first impressions. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 It will be issued in January, so that each of you can buy three copies for yourself. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 But I thought about it differently. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 I realized that although my new book made me happy, 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 And I think it makes my mom happy as well, 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 The book is not - really - about happiness. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 So I decided instead to talk about the person who 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 I think all Americans are happy 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Perhaps over the past 20 years. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Man is a great hero for me. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 A man named Howard Moskowitz 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Which was famous for its re-creation of the spaghetti sauce 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Howard in this length, and the large body, 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 In his sixties, the lenses of his glasses are very thick 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 He has light gray hair, and enjoys a high degree of vitality and sensitivity, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 He has a parrot, he likes to listen to the opera, 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 He has a keen passion for the history of the Middle Ages. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 By profession, he is a psychologist 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Now, I must tell you that I have no idea what psychological physics is, 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Although I was in a stage of my life I was dating a girl for two years and was on her way 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 To obtain a doctorate degree in psychological physics. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 I should tell you a bit about that relationship. (Laughter) 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 As far as I know, mental physics is about measuring things. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 Howard is very interested in measuring things. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 He graduated from Harvard University with a doctorate, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 He established an advisory office in White Plains, New York, 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 And one of its early clients. That was years ago in the 1970s 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 One of his earliest customers was Pepsi 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 They came to him saying, 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Learn, there is a new substance called aspartame (a low calorie local substance) 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 We would like to make Pepsi food diet. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 We want you to determine how much aspartame should be added 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 In each pack so that we have the best drink "OK? 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Now it seems like a straightforward question that needs to be answered, 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 That's what Howard thought. Because Pepsi told him, 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 "Look, we are in a desalination range between 8 percent and 12 percent. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Desalination ratio If you say about eight percent, the drink will not be sufficiently dissolved, 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 If the desalination rate increases by 12 percent, they will be dissolved at an unacceptable level. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 We want to know, what is the super-sweetening ratio between eight and 12 percent? " 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Now, if I give you this problem, you'd say it's so easy. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 What we're going to do is get a sample of the Pepsi drink for the test, 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 On all degrees of desalination .. Eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Until we reach the 12 percent rate 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 We put the results on a graph curve, 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 And we choose the most preferred concentration ratio.Also well? Very simple. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Howard tests, collects data, and places them in a graph curve, 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And suddenly he discovers that there are no curves 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 In fact, the data do not give any indication. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 It became a gale at the end of the experiment. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Now, most workers in the field of tasting foods and similar, 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Do not panic if the statements come to them so chaotic. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 They think, uh well, our discovery of people's views in a cola drink is not as easy as we thought. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Or do you know? Maybe we made a technical mistake during the experiment. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 Let's guess here, 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 They pick up the stick from the middle by choosing the 10 percent between the 8 and 12 percent. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Howard does not rest easy for him. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Howard is a man of high scientific standards. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 The result was not enough at all for him, 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 He has been fascinated by this dilemma for years 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 He was thinking deeply and wondering, Where is the mistake? 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Why can not we derive a satisfactory result from the Pepsi diet experience? 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 One day he was sitting at dinner in White Plains 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 He tries to indulge in a dream of vigilance in favor of Niskavih 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Suddenly the answer came as a bolt. 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 They were; during their analysis of Pepsi's diet data, 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 They were asking the wrong question. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 Their aim was to reach the best combination of Pepsi, 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 But they were supposed to arrive at the best combinations of Pepsi. Trust me. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 This was a tremendous inspiration 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 This was one of the most interesting discoveries in scientific research related to food. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Howard went straight into the street 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 He spoke at many conferences across the United States, 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 He was standing and saying, 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 "You were looking for the best combination of Pepsi. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 They should have been looking for the best combinations of Pepsi 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 People look at him with empty eyes, and say, 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 "What are you talking about? 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 They say, "Move! Let's listen to the next" 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 He tried to find a job for himself, and no one could hire him 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 He talks about it, talks about it and talks about it. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Howard likes the saying of Eastern European Jews 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 "Radish for radish leaves, is the world" 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 His idea was that his face - his world - was completely over him! (Laughter) 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 In the end, he had this great discovery. Flask Pickles came to him, 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Mr. Moscowets .. Moscowets. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 We want to make perfect pickles, "he told him. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 "There is no so-called perfect pickle, there are only perfect kinds of pickles" 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Then he came back to him saying, "You do not need to improve your current product, 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 You need to make it tasty. " 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 And this leads us to interesting species of pickles. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 The next person he came from was Campbell's canned drink company. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 This was in fact the most important, 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Because Howard's work for Campbell is his celebrity. 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Campbell manufactured its product Briggo, and Briggo was struggling in the Thames to stay in front of Raju, 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 Raju was the dominant spaghetti sauce in the market in the 1970s and 1980s. 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Now in the industry .. I do not know if that is of interest to you, 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 Or how much time I need to explain this. 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 But technically speaking, this is not part of the conversation. 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 Briggo tomato sauce is better than Rajo 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 The quality of the tomato is much better, and the spice mix is ​​superior to the Rajo Sauce, 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Mix pasta in a way that makes you feel better. In fact, 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 They were doing a popular test in the 1970s to compare the Raju and Brigo sauce. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 Have a spaghetti dish and add the sauce. is not it? 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 If you add a rajou clot it would settle down at the bottom of the dish, either the Briggo sauce would remain in the above. 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 This is called gluing 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 However, regardless of their superiority in the adhesion factor, 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 And the quality of tomato strength, but the Briggo sauce was struggling to stay. 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
 They came to him and asked him to fix it. 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 Howard looked at their product line and said, 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
 Your tomato industry has died. 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 So he said, this is what I would like to do. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 Then it took him to work inside Campbell's kitchen, 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 He made 45 different combinations of spaghetti sauce. With various modifications 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 Edit them according to any combination you can imagine for a tomato sauce. 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Sugar content, garlic, pH, fermentation, tomato, 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 And according to the solid objects visual .. The scientific term preferred to me in the manufacture of tomato sauce. (Laughter) 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Every way you can prepare spaghetti sauce, prepare it. 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Then they took 45 kinds of spaghetti sauce and supernatant. 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 To New York, Chicago, Jacksonville, 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 And Los Angeles. Bring a large number of people to large halls. 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 I sat them there for hours, and gave them, 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Within two hours, ten dishes. 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Ten small dishes of pasta, each dish plus a different kind of sauce. 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 After eating each dish they had to set a scale from 0 to 100, 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 Their preference for the sauce. 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 After the end of that process, after doing for months and months, 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 They had a mountain of data 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 About how Americans feel about spaghetti sauce. 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 He then analyzed the data. 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Now, was his task to find the most preferred combination of spaghetti sauce? No ! 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 Howard does not believe in the existence of such a structure. 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 Instead, look at the data said, 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 Let's see if we can aggregate this data in packets. 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Let us see if we can make sure ideas about all this. 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 Without a doubt, if I sat down analyzing all that data about spaghetti sauce, 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Realize that all Americans can be placed in three groups. 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 There are people who prefer a light crucifixion, 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 There are people who prefer spicy 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 And there are those who prefer chunky. 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 Among those facts, the third fact was the most remarkable. 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 Because at that time, in the early 1980s, 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
 If I went to the grocery store, 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 You did not find a spaghetti sauce. 

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 One of them approached Briggo, saying, 

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 "You're telling me that a third of Americans crave a spaghetti sauce 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 And so far no one makes them for them? "He answered them: Yes! 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 Briggo laughed, 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 And changed the composition of their collage of spaghetti in full, 

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 They came with their abundant bonding, which was immediately and completely 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 I acquired the spaghetti sauce market in America. 

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 Ten years later, they earned 600 million dollars 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Of their hard-packed sauce. 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 And everyone in the food industry looked at what Howard had done and said, 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
 "Oh my God, we were all thinking wrong!" 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 This has led you to find seven different types of vinegar, 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 14 different kind of mascara, 71 different kinds of olive oil .. 

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Then in the end it was appointed by Rajo, 

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 And Howard did Rajo the same thing he did to Briggo. 

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 And today, if you go to a grocery store, good, 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 I looked for how many types of Raju sauce there - 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Do you know how many? 36! 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 In six different configurations. Cheese, light, heavy, 

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Heavy and appetizing, and very compact .. for the garden. (Laughter) 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 This is Howard's achievement. This is Howard's gift to the American people. 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Now why is this an important achievement? 

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Because it is already well, in fact, tremendously important, I will explain to you why. 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
 Which Howard has done is changing the way workers in the food industry think 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 The way that makes you happy 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 Assumption 1 in the food industry was usual 

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
 In terms of knowing what people want - 

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 And what will make people happy - is to ask them. 

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 For years, years, years, and years, Raju and Brigo were both 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 By forming groups to take the opinion of the inventory groups, and sit them and ask them, 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 "What do you want to be in spaghetti sauce? Tell us what you want in spaghetti sauce." 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 And throughout those last 20 or 30 years - 

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 Through all those sessions for inventory groups 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 No one ever told them he wanted a hard-boiled sauce. 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 Even though at least one-third of them want to do so. 

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 (Laughter) 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 People do not know what you want! is not it? 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 As Howard likes to say, "The mind does not realize what the tongue wants." 

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 It's a puzzle! 

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 And a very important step to understanding our desires 

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 The tests made us realize that we can not always explain what we are. 

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 If I ask you all who in the hall for example how you like to taste your coffee, 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 Learn what you might say? Each one of you may say "I want it dark and heavy half a toaster." 

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 This is what people always say when they want to know what they like to be their coffee. 

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 How do you want it? Dark, oily, and half toaster! 

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 How many percent of you return dark, heavy and half toasted? 

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 According to Howard, the rate ranges from 25 to 27% of you 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 Most of you like it with light milk or bleach (light coffee). 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 But you will never say to someone who asks you what you want. 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 "I want it light, light." (Laughter) 

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
 So this is the first thing Howard did. 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
 The second thing that Howard did was that he made us realize .. 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 It is also a very important point. 

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 He made us realize the importance of what he would call horizontal division 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 What makes it important? This is important because 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Is this how food industry workers thought before Howard came? You understand my point? 

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
 What was in their minds at the beginning of the 1980s? The Mustard was very busy at the time. 

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Specifically, they were obsessed with the story of Bobon. is not it? 

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 There were two types of Mustard Frings and Goldens. 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 How were they? Yellow Mustard. What was in the Yellow Mustard? 

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Yellow mustard seeds, turmeric = saffron, and sweet peppers. This was the Mustard. 

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 The company emerged as Bobon and came to De Jan. is not it? 

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 With more brown mustard, some white wine, and a nose 

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
 A combination of delicious flavors. What are they doing? 

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 They put the recovered in a small glass jar, with a wonderful brand, 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 They make it look French, though it is made in Oxnard, California 

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Instead of pricing the 8-ounce package for a dollar and a half, 

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 In the way of Franchises and Goldens, they decided they priced it for four dollars. 

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 Then they fired those ads, did not they? The man in the Rolls-Royce, 

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 With the return of the Bobon, the other Rolls-Royce suddenly stops 

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 And ask her commander, do you have another one of the Bardon Mustard? 

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And having done all this, Bobon flew into the sky! 

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 And took control of the Mustard market! 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
 The lesson learned for each person was 

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 That way people make happy 

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 Is to give them something more pricey, something they aspire to. is not it? 

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 Is to make them give back to the thing they love now, 

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 And make them seek the highest hierarchy of bastards. 

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Best Mustard! And the highest price! 

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
 Mustardism with more complexity, culture and meaning. 

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 And Howard looked at that result and said, This is a mistake! 

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Mustard does not exist on this hierarchy. 

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Mustard is only present - as is the tomato sauce, horizontal level. 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 There is no so-called good or bad bastard. 

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 There are no perfect mustard and other defective. 

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 There are - just - different types of mascara suits different types of people. 

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 Make our thinking radically democratic on the issue of taste. 

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 This is why we also condemn Howard Moskowitz to join our voices in a loud thank-you speech. 

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 The third thing that Howard did, perhaps most importantly, 

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 That Howard resisted the Platonic theory. (Laughter) 

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 What do I mean? 

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 For the longer period in the food industry, 

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 There was a feeling that there was one way, like me, to prepare a dish. 

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 If you go to the Chez Paniz restaurant, they give you a chashimi dish made of red-tailed fish 

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 With roasted pumpkin seeds in something .. something moderate. 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 And they do not give you five choices for this, okay? 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
 Do not tell you you want it with the most severe, or do you want it .. NO! 

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 Submitted to you only. Why? Because the chef at the Chase Paniz restaurant 

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 He has a Platonic theory of the Shashimi. 

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 That is how it should be presented. 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 It is presented in this way over and over again, 

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 And if she argued it will tell you 

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 "You know, you're wrong! That's the best way this restaurant should be." 

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Now it is the same idea as the food industry. 

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 They had a theory, Platonic theory, for what was tomato sauce. 

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 Where did you come from? She came from Italy. 

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 Italian tomato sauce is what? Such as light juice. 

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 The culture of tomato sauce is to be light. 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 When we talked about original tomato sauce in the 1970s, 

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 We talked about Italian tomato sauce. We talked about Raju's first production 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 And none of its components were powder-free, was it? 

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 It was light, and once you add a little 

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 The noodles permeate and settle down. 

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 That was the case. And why were we related to this? 

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 Because we thought that makes people happy 

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Hyan provide them with the most common original tomato sauce, this is No. 1 

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 # 2, that if we gave them that sauce, 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
 They will welcome them. 

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 This will make the most people happy. 

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 And the reason why we think so .. In another way, 

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 Cookers were looking for global rules. 

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 They were looking for one way to make us happy. 

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 There is good reason to be enthusiastic about the idea of ​​global rules, 

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 Because all scientific fields in the nineteenth century and most of the twentieth century ' 

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 They had that idea. 

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Psychologists, medicine, and economics; they were all interested in discovery 

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Rules that govern our behavior. 

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 But that changed. is not it? 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 Is not that a great scientific revolution that happened in the last 10 or 15 years? 

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 It is a move from seeking general rules to understanding variables. 

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Now in medical science, we do not necessarily want to know .. 

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 How cancer activates only; but we want to know how its type differs from person to person 

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 I think my cancer is different from yours. 

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 Embryology opened the door to study the diversity of human beings. 

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 What Howard Moskowitz was doing was to contribute to that revolution 

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 Which was needed by the world of tomato sauce. 

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 That is why we owe him deep thanks. 

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 I will give you another picture of diversity pictures, which .. Oh I'm sorry. 

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
 Howard did not think only what he was doing but took him to a higher level, 

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 He said that by exploring global principles in the food industry, 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 Not only do we make a mistake, we actually mistreat ourselves. 

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 He used to hit a coffee example to make it clear. 

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 The coffee field has given him a lot of work for the company Nescafe. 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 If I ask you, try to choose a coffee brand for me 

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 A combination or mix will make you all happy, 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 And I asked you to establish the kind that you have gathered, 

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 The average score for those in this room will be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100. 

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 However, if you would allow me to divide you into packages that reflect your preference for coffee, 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 Maybe three or four packs, 

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 And I can prepare a coffee type for each group, 

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 That result will jump to 75 or 78. 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 The difference between a vote for coffee by 60% and others 

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Is the difference between coffee that makes you loathe, 

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 And coffee that makes you very happy. 

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 This is the end, and I think the most interesting lessons of Howard Moskowitz are 

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 It is built for diversity among humans, 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 We will find a more sure way towards true happiness. 

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 thank you
